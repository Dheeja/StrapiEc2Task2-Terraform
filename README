Strapi Deployment on AWS EC2 Using Terraform 

📌 Introduction

This guide explains how to deploy a Strapi CMS on an AWS EC2 instance using Terraform. We will provision the infrastructure, install Strapi, and access the admin panel.

🛠 Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- Terraform (>= 1.0.0)
- AWS CLI (>= 2.0)
- An AWS account with IAM permissions
- SSH key pair (for EC2 login)

⚙️ Deployment Steps

- Initialize Terraform – This sets up your working directory for Terraform usage.
- Apply Terraform Configuration – Terraform provisions an EC2 instance with the required dependencies.
- Access EC2 via SSH – Log into the server using an SSH key to manage Strapi installation.
- Install Strapi – Install Node.js and Strapi on the EC2 instance.
- Run Strapi Server – Start Strapi and expose the admin panel for configuration.
- Access the Dashboard – Open http://<EC2-Public-IP>:1337/admin to manage content.


🎯 Verifying Deployment

Once deployed, test the setup by visiting:

👉 http://<EC2-Public-IP>:1337/admin

To ensure Strapi is running, you can also check:

curl http://<EC2-Public-IP>:1337/

🔄 Cleanup

To remove AWS resources when no longer needed, use 

Terraform’s destroy command:

terraform destroy -auto-approve
