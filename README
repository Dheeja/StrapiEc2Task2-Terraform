Strapi Deployment on AWS EC2 Using Terraform
📌 Introduction
This guide explains how to deploy a Strapi CMS on an AWS EC2 instance using Terraform. We will provision the infrastructure, install Strapi, and access the admin panel.
🛠 Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
•	- Terraform (>= 1.0.0)
•	- AWS CLI (>= 2.0)
•	- An AWS account with IAM permissions
•	- SSH key pair (for EC2 login)
⚙️ Deployment Steps
1.	Initialize Terraform – This sets up your working directory for Terraform usage.
2.	Apply Terraform Configuration – Terraform provisions an EC2 instance with the required dependencies.
3.	Access EC2 via SSH – Log into the server using an SSH key to manage Strapi installation.
4.	Install Strapi – Install Node.js and Strapi on the EC2 instance.
5.	Run Strapi Server – Start Strapi and expose the admin panel for configuration.
6.	Access the Dashboard – Open http://<EC2-Public-IP>:1337/admin to manage content.
🎯 Verifying Deployment
Once deployed, test the setup by visiting:
👉 http://<EC2-Public-IP>:1337/admin
To ensure Strapi is running, you can also check:
curl http://<EC2-Public-IP>:1337/
🔄 Cleanup
To remove AWS resources when no longer needed, use Terraform’s destroy command:
terraform destroy -auto-approve
